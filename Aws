Hi Team,

a) How did you find out about the charges?
I found out about the charges when I reviewed my billing dashboard and noticed unexpected costs. I was surprised to see usage charges that I didn’t anticipate.


b) Do you consider you have enough tools and knowledge to avoid this from happening in the future?
Yes. After seeing these charges, I spent time reviewing AWS billing alerts, budgets, and documentation. I believe I now have enough tools and understanding to monitor usage closely and avoid such unexpected charges going forward.


c) How long were you actively using these services?
I did not intentionally use the services for long. It appears they remained running without my realizing it, which caused the charges. Once I noticed, I took steps to stop them.


d) How did this error happen (please be specific of the reason why this feature was launched even though there was unawareness of the pricing and the configuration required):
This happened because I was testing and exploring AWS features without fully understanding the cost implications. I mistakenly launched resources or services for experimentation but did not realize they would continue to incur charges in the background. I failed to terminate them properly, which led to ongoing costs. It was an oversight due to my lack of experience with the billing model at that time.


e) Why did it take this long to engage us?
It took me time to understand the source of the charges and to verify that I couldn’t resolve the billing issue on my own. Once I confirmed the charges were unintended and could not be reversed through normal means, I contacted AWS Support for help.


f) Do you agree to review the pricing structure for resources that you intend to use before launching them?
Yes, absolutely. I understand the importance of reviewing the pricing structure in advance. I will make sure to carefully review all pricing details and configurations before launching any future AWS resources.

Regards,

Richard Xavier
