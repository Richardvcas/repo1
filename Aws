The Confluence page for VM Lifecycle Automation using Flask API + GitLab + Argo CD is now published.
This is created for testing the complete workflow from user request (via API) to VM deployment in OpenShift.
It includes high-level flow, screenshots, and YAML definitions for all implemented test cases (Pave, Resize, Repave, Delete)
